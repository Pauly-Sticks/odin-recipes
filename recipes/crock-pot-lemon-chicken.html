        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Take chicken and marinate in the juice of two lemons and 1 cup of the greek yougurt for at least an hour.</li>
                <li>Chop the potatoes and onions into large bite sized pieces./li>
                <li>Place the onions, potatoes, carrots (if you like carrots), chicken stock, garlic and the juice of two of the lemons 
                    into the crockpot and set on low.<strong>Do not add the chicken yet.</strong> </li>
                <li>Add the chicken boullion and pepper to taste. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>You want it to be just under your liking salt wise.</li>
                        <li>The feta and capers will add more salty flavor later.</li>
                        <li>Getting the salt right at this point will keep the potatoes from being bland later.</li>
                        <li>The broth will not taste great. You are only checking for saltiness</li>
                        <li><em><strong>Do not taste the broth if you already added the raw chicken.</strong></em></li>
                            <!--Note the em and strong elements combined-->
                    </ul>
                        <!--Note the unordered list within an ordered list-->
                <li>Now add the chicken and cover. Cook for 7 hours.</li>
                <li>Add the feta, capers and artichoke and cook for another half an hour.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup of the greek yogurt and cook another 15 minuts.</li>
                <li>Shred the chicken, mix well and serve!</li>
